# 🎤 VocalLabs – Speech Analysis Software for Toastmasters

VocalLabs is a mobile-based speech analysis and feedback system designed to help users—especially Toastmasters—improve their public speaking skills. This cross-platform application provides insights into filler word usage, voice modulation, vocabulary, grammar, and more, using powerful machine learning and natural language processing techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Speech Analysis**: Transcribes and analyzes recorded speech in real-time.
- 🧠 **Filler Word Detection**: Identifies and counts overused filler words.
- 🎚 **Voice Modulation Evaluation**: Analyzes pitch variation and delivery.
- 📊 **Vocabulary & Grammar Feedback**: Assesses word complexity and grammatical accuracy.
- 🧾 **Speech Structure Assessment**: Evaluates introduction, body, and conclusion quality.
- 📱 **Mobile App**: Built with Flutter for Android and iOS platforms.
- ☁️ **Real-time Storage**: Firebase integration for seamless data persistence.
- 🔐 **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system.
